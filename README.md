## Description 

This a CLI or command line interface application uses Node.js, which is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, in other words it allows execution of our code outside a web-browser. This application also utilizes npm or node package manaer, which is a software registry or a library of helpful application. I learned modularization (require() and module.exports) and using Inquirers as well as some other npm packages (fs & path).
